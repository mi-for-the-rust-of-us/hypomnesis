/// `GpuDeviceInfo` will be exposed as new defaulted setters here.
///
/// Each setter consumes `self` and returns `Self`, enabling a chained
/// construction (`GpuDeviceInfo::builder().index(1).total_bytes(N).build()`).
/// Unset fields take the documented defaults: `index = 0`, `name = None`,
/// `total_bytes = 0`, `free_bytes = 0`, `used_bytes = 0`,
/// `reserved_bytes = None`, `driver_version = None`.

///
/// The `test-helpers` feature is **not** semver-stable in the same sense
/// as the production API. New setters are expected to land alongside any
/// new field added to `GpuDeviceInfo`, and downstream tests using the
